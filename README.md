# Staller-Object-Prediction

🌌 Stellar Object Prediction

A Machine Learning project to classify celestial objects as Star, Galaxy, or Quasar based on astronomical observation data.

📌 Project Overview

This project uses supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the type of stellar object using features like:

Right Ascension (RA)

Declination (DEC)

Ultraviolet filter (u)

Green filter (g)

Red filter (r)

Near Infrared filter (i)

Infrared filter (z)

Redshift

The dataset is typically taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
